## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
// In regards to asking questions, I think that I usually wait too long. Either another person asks the question I have or the time to ask questions ends. This does push me to do my own research but it also tends to slow me down.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
// A number is a data type that uses all numbers including negative numbers and decimals.
	A string data type is wrapped between single or double quotes, and uses letters and other characters.
	A boolean data type represents true and false


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
// console.log(‘Hello world!’);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// The purpose for code comments are to add information for other developers and they can also put code on hold.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
// A variable can be used to store information for multiple places and can also be changed

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
// Instagram is an app that is frequently used. The number variable can be the number of likes. A string variable can be the comment or caption on a post. And a boolean can show whether one is online or off.


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
// Concatenation is one of the ways to add different variables into a string.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
// Most of the websites or apps that require a login probably require the use of concatenation. Whenever your name or username comes up and a profile picture as well.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
// Interpolation seems easier to use. Can I only use interpolation or are there situations where I have to use concatenation?
