## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

* It was tough but overall I think good practice. Trying to figure out how to word
my questions for google or youtube showed me I was not the only one who was
struggling. And it was good to know that I could still message my classmates or
teachers if I needed extra help.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

* Our contact list on our phones. This list can be numbered or in alphabetical order,
and each name comes with a number and a little more unique information.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is

* Arrays is the plural version of whatever is inside. Like how the alphabet holds
letters, but you can edit this alphabet however you want.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

* The purpose of a loop is to save time and process what humans can not.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

* Tell them to write their name on a leaf and then tell them to imagine every other leaf they
can see has their name on it now too.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

* Are arrays and loops considered a type of algorithm.
