## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

* In the article, there was an acronym called smart that resonated with me. Smart mentioned great guidelines to setting goals.
* Taking a break, understanding that not every day is going to go how we want but as long as we never give up we have a growth mindset.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

* I'm starting to mentally prepare myself the next day, like planning on my calendar.
I feel like I don't have a growth mindset when I sleep in.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

* It was a good experience to look online and in my book for questions.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* In real life could be if I am hungry. Whether or not to eat or continue doing
what ever I was doing
* Online could be if you typed your password in correctly or not.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

* Else if statements can provide different outcomes for the same statements. Initially
will run the first statement but will run the next in order if conditions are not met.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

* && needs both conditions to be met, || only one condition needs to be met
* True and false booleans can be changed and checked, and can also use strings.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

* Is there are limit to how many else if statements you can have?
